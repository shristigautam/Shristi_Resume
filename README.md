# Resume App

*Note: email shristigautam@miu.edu and password “Shristi@123” have been initially saved in Shared Preferences, so please use these credentials to log in and check the app.
While developing this project, I have used Fragments, Intents, Menus, Tab Layout, Shared Preferences, Material Design, Swipe View, WebView and many other things learned in class.

1)	Login Activity with Validation from Shared Preference:

2)	Home Fragment and About Me Fragment:

3)	Work Fragment – I have used Recycler view for loading work experience data dynamically using Work Adapter. I have used FloatingActionButton and AlertDialog to add new experience.

The experience marked with red color is the newly added experience from the Alert Dialog.

4)	Contact Fragment – I have used ACTION_DIAL intent for the phone call and WebView for opening the three links.

5)	Logout Menu – I have used Overflow Menu for extra option (Logout) which clears the login value from shared preference and redirects the user to the Login page.
