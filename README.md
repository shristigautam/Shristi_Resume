# Resume App

*Note: email shristigautam@miu.edu and password “Shristi@123” have been initially saved in Shared Preferences, so please use these credentials to log in and check the app.
While developing this project, I have used Fragments, Intents, Menus, Tab Layout, Shared Preferences, Material Design, Swipe View, WebView and many other things learned in class.

1)	Login Activity with Validation from Shared Preference

2)	Home Fragment and About Me Fragment
  

3)	Work Fragment – I have used Recycler view for loading work experience data dynamically using Work Adapter. I have used FloatingActionButton and AlertDialog to add new experience.



The experience marked with red color is the newly added experience from the Alert Dialog.
 



4)	Contact Fragment – I have used ACTION_DIAL intent for the phone call and WebView for opening the three links.
  
  

5)	Logout Menu – I have used Overflow Menu for extra option (Logout) which clears the login value from shared preference and redirects the user to the Login page.
